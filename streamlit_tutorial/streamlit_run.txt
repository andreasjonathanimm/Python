First you sprinkle a few streamlit commands on top of your existing code, then you run it with streamlit run:
streamlit run my_app.py [-- script-args]

A local Streamlit server will spin up and you’ll see your app in your browser. You can then edit your code and refresh the browser to see the changes.

Another way to run Streamlit is to run it as a Python module. This is useful if you want to run Streamlit from a Jupyter notebook or from a Python script.
# Running
python -m streamlit run my_app.py [-- script-args]

# is equivalent to:
streamlit run my_app.py [-- script-args]

Tip:
You can also pass a URL to streamlit run. This is useful if you want to run a Streamlit app that’s hosted on GitHub.
